# üöö Route Efficiency Simulation Tool

A lightweight Python tool for simulating vehicle telematics trip data and analyzing route efficiency. This project evaluates average fuel consumption, distance traveled, and driving speed, exporting the results to a CSV file suitable for visualization in Power BI or Excel.

---

## üìå Overview

This tool generates synthetic trip records for a small vehicle fleet and calculates route-level performance metrics. It's useful for prototyping telematics analysis, modeling fleet behavior, or academic projects involving mobility data.

## üß† Features

- Simulates trips for multiple vehicles across different routes
- Stores data in a local SQLite database (`telematics.db`)
- Calculates route-level metrics:
  - Average distance per trip
  - Average fuel used
  - Fuel efficiency (km/L)
  - Average speed (km/h)
- Outputs results to `route_efficiency_report.csv` for dashboarding
